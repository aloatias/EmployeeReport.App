# EmployeeReport.App
My solution to the BirthdayGreetings Kata described here: http://codingdojo.org/kata/Employee-Report/

You’re building an employee management system of a local grocery store. The shop-owner wants to open the shop on Sunday and due to legal restrictions employees younger than 18 years are not allowed to work Sundays. The employee asks for a reporting feature so she can schedule work shifts. All employees are already stored somewhere and have the following properties:  name: string (the name of the employee) age: number (the age in years of the employee)

Requirements:
  . Npm packages installed
  . Node.js runtime
  
Write on the command line "ng test" to launch angular's jasmine test suite and see the results.
